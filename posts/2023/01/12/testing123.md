This is a test blog post to test publishing from GitHub to Medium.

Publishing posts from GitHub to Medium is a great way to share your technical content with a wider audience. By connecting your GitHub repository to Medium, you can automatically publish your posts to the platform and reach a larger audience.

To get started, you will need to create an account on Medium if you don't have one already. Click on your account icon and go to **Manage publications**

Click on the **New publication** button and proceed to create your publication.

Once you have a publication, you can connect your GitHub repository to Medium by using a GitHub Action. This will allow you to publish your posts automatically every time you push a new commit to your repository.
