# 2025 Reflections

In the coming weeks, we’ll enter into a long-term partnership with a Dutch company—one that begins as a six-figure deal in 2026 and has the potential to grow into a seven-figure engagement over the next few years.
As a company, we couldn’t have asked for a better way to end the year.

This moment feels especially meaningful when I think back to last December.

At the time, my co-founder Wale was leading our friends-and-family round. The goal was simple: raise just enough to give us a 12-month runway — to speak with companies,
deeply understand real problems worth solving, and build an MVP.
We already had a very flexible and powerful platform for building AI-powered applications; what we didn’t yet have was a focused product built on top of it.
Finding and building that product became our mission for the year.

That has been our journey for the past 12 months.

Our long-term vision at ProteusAI is to become a leading provider of AI-driven workplace productivity tools.
The upcoming (yet-to-be-announced) partnership with a Dutch company aligns perfectly with that vision. Through this engagement, we are positioned to introduce practical,
useful AI and much-needed automation into a specific part of the Dutch banking and finance industry — more details to come in the weeks ahead.

The first tool shaped by this vision is **OnBuddy**.

With OnBuddy, our goal is for every person in every organization to have a personal AI companion—one that helps them find information, take action across the third-party tools their organization already uses,
and automate important business processes. This is the tool we set out to *find* at the beginning of the year. This is the tool we *found* after weeks of user research.
We officially launched OnBuddy on December 6th during our Mixer event in Lagos, and we’ve already started receiving incredibly valuable feedback from early users.
This year, we spent most of our time *describing* what we were building; in 2026, we’ll begin *showing* it.

Now, here we are—another December.

I’m deeply grateful for the year we’ve had: the losses, the wins, the missteps, and the lessons. Grateful for our small but exceptional team that continues to punch far above its weight.
Grateful to the friends and family who supported and invested in us last December and January. Grateful to everyone who spoke with us during user research, to the early customers who took a leap of faith,
to friends of the company who gave us their time and insight freely, to those who attended events we organized or sponsored, to the publications that wrote about us,
and to everyone cheering us on from near or far.

In 2025, we learned the value of courage.

We negotiated with organizations much larger than us, organized events we had no prior experience running, and reached for goals that initially felt out of reach. We believed that if we dared to start,
fortune would favor us. And in 2026, we intend to be even more daring.

P.S. We’re currently in the middle of another friends-and-family round. The first round helped us build our solutions; this one will help accelerate their distribution.
We’ll be organizing this round via Borderless (https://www.onborderless.com/), with a live link available in January.
